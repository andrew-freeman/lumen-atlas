# Camera calibration tools

Placeholder for camera-driven calibration workflows. Scripts here should:

- capture sequences where LEDs are activated sparsely or sequentially
- emit observations that align with `camera_observations` in `schema/led_node.schema.json`
- stay hardware-agnostic, focusing on reproducible data capture and export
